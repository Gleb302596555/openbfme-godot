# Weapon::calcProjectileLaunchPosition (RW 0x6CAB85) turns the launch transform of a projectile by the turret's angle and pitch
# (the flag WeaponTemplate + 0x16C, the turret of RW 0x66246B); its engine changes are in files other lists already carry
# (ProjectileModules, AIUpdate, Weapon.h, TurretAI.h).
